event-propagator
================

### This project is defunct and outdated. I would not recommend using it, but feel free to browse the code and steal anything useful.

This is a small module that provides functions and an extension to the EventEmitter class to provide mechanisms of forwarding events from one emitter to another.

## Quickstart

```javascript
import {propagate} from 'event-propagator';
import {EventEmitter} from 'events';
import {createServer} from 'http';

let server = createServer((req, res) => {
    res.end('Hello, World!');
}).listen(8080);

let myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

propagate(server, myEmitter, 'listening');

myEmitter.on('listening', function() {
    console.log('Listening event propated from server to myEmitter');
});
```

However, it also allows you to do single propagation that remove the listener automatically after the first event received, and the ability to cancel the propagation of an event by inserting a "middleware" kind of function into the propagation handler.

For example:
```javascript
//Continued from above
propagate(server, myEmitter, 'connection', (socket) => {
    if(socket.remoteFamily === 'IPv4') {
        return false; //cancels propagation
    }
});

myEmitter.on('connection', function(socket) {
    console.log('New IPv6 connection');
    
    socket.setNoDelay();
});
```

Of course this is very trivial and not any more useful than a normal event listener. Where event propagation is most useful, however, is in deeply nested structures.

For example, I use this library in another library/program that manages loaded scripts and watches their files for changes. If a script's file changes, then a 'change' event must be propagated upwards to whatever scripts depend on it. It allows bubbling up of events.
 
 
## API

##### `isPropagating(source: EventEmitter, target: EventEmitter, event: string)` -> `bool`

Returns true if the given event is currently being propagated from the source to the target. As in, it is listening on the source for the given event.

##### `propagate(source: EventEmitter, target: EventEmitter, event: string, onEvent: fn() -> any|false, onlyOnce: bool, context: any)`

Will set up a listener on the source emitter to propagate the given event to the target, but only if the `onEvent` function returns non-false.

if `onlyOnce` is true, after the first propagation, the listener will remove itself and will not be able to be called again.

`context` is what `onEvent` is called with. E.g., `onEvent.call(context)`

Only one propagation handler is allowed at a time, to avoid doubling up. If you wish to change any of these settings, the propagation handler will need to be removed using `stopPropagating` and then added back.

`onEvent` defaults to an empty function, `onlyOnce` defaults to `false`, and context defaults to undefined.

##### `propagateOnce(source: EventEmitter, target: EventEmitter, event: string, onEvent: fn() -> any|false, context: any)`

A variation of the above where you don't need to specify a new onEvent but will still set `onlyOnce` to true.

##### `stopPropagating(source: EventEmitter, target: EventEmitter, event: string)`

Stops propagating any/all propagators added to source to propagate events to target.

##### `EventPropagator extends EventEmitter`

A class that extends EventEmitter from the `'events'` module to add the following functions:

* `isPropagatingTo(target: EventEmitter, event: string)` -> `bool`
* `isPropagatingFrom(source; EventEmitter, event: string)` -> `bool`
* `propagateTo(target: EventEmitter, event: string, onEvent: fn() -> any|false, onlyOnce: bool, context: any)`
    - Context defaults to `this`
* `propagateFrom(source: EventEmitter, event: string, onEvent: fn() -> any|false, onlyOnce: bool, context: any)`
    - Context defaults to `this`
* `stopPropagatingTo(target: EventEmitter, event: string)`
* `stopPropagatingFrom(source: EventEmitter, event: string)`

These are mostly just calls to the normal API given above, with `this` acting as the source or target depending on the function, but is provided for convenience.
